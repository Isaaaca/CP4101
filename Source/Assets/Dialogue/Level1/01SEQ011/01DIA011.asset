    text: What's that strange thing on the lycan's head?

    text: Ah that's the mark. It lets everyone know that the lycan has turned into
      a werewolf and assaulted someone before.

    text: I presume it's for the protection of the public. Has it been effective?
    options: []

    text: To be honest, I'm not sure.

    lookAt: 01NPC008
    text: People are afraid of the mark, that's for sure. But the offending lycan
      always has a hard time reintegrating into society. Some say the mark even increases
      the chances of reoffending.
    options: []
  - speaker: Hal
    lookAt: 01NPC008
    text: Good thing there's no need to decide for the case at hand I guess. Once
      a lycan has been marked it cannot be removed.
    options: []
  - speaker: Sheriff
    lookAt: Player
    text: Hmm... That means for future cases I'll have to make the call, doesn't
      it?
    options: []
  - speaker: Hal
    lookAt: 01NPC008
    text: Yes. All the best with that. Even for this case you'll have to decide some
      things though. I'll explain it to you later.
